# DataScience_GPX

This project involves <b>19 GPX data files</b> that were scraped from a Web API and are included for reference.

GPX (GPS Exchange Format) data is a type of XML-based file format designed for storing and sharing GPS (Global Positioning System) data. It is commonly used in applications involving mapping, navigation, and outdoor activities such as hiking, cycling, and geocaching. GPX files are widely supported by GPS devices, mapping software, and online mapping services, making them a standard format for exchanging GPS data across different platforms and applications.

The GPX files describe long, famous European bike routes. These bike routes are known as the <b>EuroVelo</b>, which is a network of long distance cycle routes connecting and uniting the whole European continent.

Data cleaning, processing, and comparative analysis is performed on both of these collections of data to form discussion topics and to answer interesting analysis questions, for example:

- What is the longest stage of a specific route, for example EuroVelo 6?
- What is the stage in a specific route should a cyclist prepare for the most uphill?
- If a cyclist plans to undertake a specific route and is planning a rest period, when are the 3 flattest continuous stages in that route?
- If a cyclist is looking for a particular challenge in a route of his choice, when are the 5 most uphill continuous stages in that route?

These GPX analyses is then contrasted with a different Web API containing information pertaining to the EuroVelo: TomTom API.

Discussion points and analyses are stored in the Jupyter Notebook.
